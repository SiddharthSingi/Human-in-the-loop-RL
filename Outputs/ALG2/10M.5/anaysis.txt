This is a great example of why the qtable values should make sense. Our best_action plot needs to be taking our agent away from the 
traps. In this particular example, the top left cells have converged to an absurd action that keeps bringing the agent back to the
same cell. When vanilla rolout was executed on this qtable values the std_dev, mean of return and the counts have all been spoiled because
of this policy. A similar thing has happened in Sandip's memo where the best action plots keep making the agent oscillate between
two cells
This is one of the major reason why alg2 for sandip has been so significantly better than his vanilla agent.
